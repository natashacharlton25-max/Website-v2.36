# Services for Professionals

## Quality resources to support the people you work with.

You're already doing meaningful work with trauma survivors, helping them rebuild, find stability, and move forward. We're here to make that work a little easier.

Walking with a Smile offers practical, trauma-informed resources designed for professionals who share our values: empowerment over dependency, choice over prescription, and tools that work in real life.

Whether you're looking for ready-made resources, something tailored to your practice, or materials you can offer under your own brand, we can help.
