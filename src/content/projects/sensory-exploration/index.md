title: "Sensory Exploration"
description: "A hands-on collection of sensory activities and resources to support sensory processing and integration."
longDescription: |
  Sensory Exploration brings together activities and resources that engage all the senses, supporting sensory processing, body awareness, and regulation. This project is designed to help individuals explore their sensory preferences and develop healthy sensory processing patterns.

  From tactile experiences to movement activities, each resource encourages active engagement and discovery. The collection can be adapted for individual or group use, and is particularly valuable for those with sensory processing differences.

  intention: "To provide varied, engaging sensory experiences that support sensory integration, body awareness, and self-regulation across different environments."
  summary: "This collection offers evidence-informed sensory activities that can be incorporated into therapeutic practice, educational settings, or home environments. Resources are designed to be adaptable and accessible."
  guidanceNotes: |
    **Assessment & Observation:**
    Observe individual responses to different sensory inputs. Note preferences, aversions, and neutral responses.

    **Creating a Sensory Diet:**
    Work with occupational therapy guidance to develop a personalized sensory diet that meets individual needs throughout the day.

    **Safety Considerations:**
    - Always supervise sensory activities
    - Check for allergies and sensitivities
    - Ensure materials are age-appropriate
    - Provide choice and control over intensity

    **Adapting Activities:**
    Modify intensity, duration, and complexity based on individual needs and responses. Follow the child's lead and watch for signs of overwhelm.

    **Integration:**
    Use sensory activities as part of transitions, breaks, or focused intervention time. Consistency helps build predictability and routine.
