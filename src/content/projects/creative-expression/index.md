    **Creating a Safe Space:**
    Establish a judgment-free environment where all creative expressions are valued. Emphasize that there are no mistakes in creative work.

    **Facilitating Creative Activities:**
    - Provide choice in materials and mediums
    - Model creativity without demonstrating "correct" outcomes
    - Use open-ended questions rather than directives
    - Celebrate effort and exploration, not just finished products

    **Supporting Different Learning Styles:**
    Offer multiple modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile) and allow individuals to choose their preferred mode of expression.

    **Working with Resistance:**
    Some individuals may feel anxious about creative activities. Start small, provide structure when needed, and normalize the creative process.
