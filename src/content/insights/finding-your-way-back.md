# Finding Your Way Back to You: Rebuilding Self-Worth After Trauma

*A gentle guide to rediscovering who you are, written by someone who's walked this path too*

---

## Welcome

There's something that happens when life knocks us down hard. Not just the obvious stuff—the sleepless nights, the anxiety that sits in your chest like a stone, the way certain sounds or smells can transport you right back to moments you'd rather forget. There's something quieter that happens too. Something that sneaks in when you're not looking and sets up camp in the deepest parts of who you are.

It whispers things like: *You're too much. You're not enough. You're broken beyond repair.*

If you're reading this, chances are you know exactly what I'm talking about. Maybe you've been carrying that weight for years. Maybe it's newer, still raw and confusing. Either way, I want you to know something right from the start: those whispers are lying to you.

This isn't a clinical guide written by someone looking down from an ivory tower. This is a conversation between friends—between people who've been in the trenches of their own healing and learned a few things worth sharing. Nothing here is meant to replace professional support if you need it. But sometimes, what we need most is someone to sit beside us and say, "Yeah, I've been there too. And here's what helped me find my way back."

So grab a cup of tea, find a comfortable spot, and let's talk about something that matters: remembering that you were always worth loving, even when trauma tried to convince you otherwise.

## Understanding

Before we can rebuild something, it helps to understand what got dismantled in the first place.

Trauma doesn't just affect what happened to us—it rewires how we see ourselves. This isn't weakness or a character flaw. It's neurobiology. When we experience overwhelming events, especially ones that involve other people hurting us or systems failing us, our brains draw conclusions to try to make sense of it all.

And here's the cruel irony: the conclusions we draw are almost always about ourselves being the problem.

A child who is neglected doesn't think, "My parents are struggling with their own issues and can't meet my needs." They think, "I must not be worth caring for." A person who experiences violence doesn't naturally conclude, "That person chose to harm me." The mind often lands on, "I must have done something to deserve this" or "If I were different, this wouldn't have happened."

These aren't logical thoughts. They're survival mechanisms. Our brains desperately want to find patterns and explanations because that feels safer than accepting that bad things can happen randomly, that people we trust can hurt us, that the world can be chaotic and unfair.

The problem is, these protective conclusions don't stay confined to the traumatic experience. They seep into everything. They become the lens through which we see all our relationships, all our choices, all our possibilities. They become so familiar that we mistake them for truth.

Understanding this is the first step. You didn't choose to feel this way about yourself. You didn't wake up one day and decide to believe you weren't good enough. Your mind was trying to protect you, and it grabbed onto whatever explanation it could find. That explanation just happened to be wrong.
