# Setting Healthy Boundaries: A Practical Guide

Boundaries aren't walls to keep people out. They're gates that let the right people in while protecting you from harm.

## What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are the limits we set to protect our physical, emotional, and mental well-being. They define what we're comfortable with and how we want to be treated by others.

## Why Boundaries Matter

Without healthy boundaries, we can feel:
- Overwhelmed and exhausted
- Resentful toward others
- Unable to prioritize our own needs
- Disconnected from our authentic selves

## Types of Boundaries

1. **Physical Boundaries** - Your personal space and physical touch
2. **Emotional Boundaries** - Your feelings and emotional energy
3. **Time Boundaries** - How you spend your time
4. **Mental Boundaries** - Your thoughts, values, and opinions

## How to Set Boundaries

1. **Identify Your Limits** - What makes you uncomfortable?
2. **Communicate Clearly** - Use "I" statements
3. **Be Consistent** - Follow through
4. **Expect Pushback** - Some people won't like your boundaries
5. **Prioritize Self-Care** - You deserve to feel safe

## Common Boundary Statements

- "I need some time to think about that"
- "That doesn't work for me"
- "I'm not comfortable with that"
- "I need space right now"

Remember: Setting boundaries is an act of self-respect, not selfishness.
