longDescription: |
  <p>Walking With A Smile's 7-Day Self-Directed Living Starter Kit is a gentle and practical way for people to move away from automatic patterns and towards more intentional choices in everyday life. The kit breaks change into small, realistic steps that focus on awareness, intention, boundaries, connection, movement, gratitude and reflection.
