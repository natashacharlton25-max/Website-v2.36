    "Walking with a Smile is about helping trauma survivors move from a life centred on pain to one centred on themselves.",
    "That sounds big. But really, it's practical. It's resources you can actually use. A community that gets it. And a general philosophy of: you're in charge here, we're just offering tools.",
    "We're not here to rescue anyone. We're not here to tell you how your healing should go. We're just here to open a few doors and let you decide which ones to walk through."
