    "I spent most of my life thinking that constant stress, fear, and anxiety were just part of who I was. Like some people are tall, some people are funny, and I was just... anxious. Heavy. Always waiting for the next bad thing.",
    "The weight of trauma felt like something I'd carry forever. I wasn't living, really. I was surviving. Keeping my head above water and calling it a life.",
    "Then one day, I got tired of it. Not in a dramatic, lightning-bolt kind of way. Just quietly fed up. I thought: what if I stopped letting this thing run the show? What have I actually got to lose?",
    "So I started pushing back. Slowly. Messily. Not perfectly. And something shifted.",
    "When I finally stopped letting trauma be the first thing I introduced about myself, the whole world got bigger. I found out I actually liked who I was underneath all that weight. I could breathe. I could be curious about life instead of just bracing for it.",
    "I didn't need to be \"the person who went through that thing\" anymore. I was just... me. And that was enough.",
    "That's when I knew I wanted to create something for other people who might be ready for the same shift. Not a programme that tells you what to do. Not advice from someone who thinks they've got it all figured out. Just a space with useful stuff in it, for people to take what helps and leave the rest.",
    "Because everyone deserves to feel lighter. Everyone deserves to walk with a smile."
