Image Sizes for Presentations
==============================
Each presentation has its own folder with co-located images.

Image specs:
- card.png/card.jpg: 1200x630 (1.91:1 landscape) - for grid cards in insights/assets/projects listings
- hero.png/hero.jpg: 1920x1080 (16:9 landscape) - optional hero background (falls back to card if not set)
- Section images: 1920x1080 (16:9 landscape) - named by section ID (e.g., permission.png, compassion.png)

Folder structure:
src/content/presentations/
├── {presentation-slug}/
│   ├── index.md (frontmatter + sections)
│   ├── card.png or card.jpg
│   ├── hero.png (optional - uses card if not set)
│   └── {section-id}.png (for image-text and full-width-image layouts)

Example for "finding-your-way-back" presentation:
src/content/presentations/finding-your-way-back/
├── index.md
├── card.png         (1200x630 - grid cards)
├── hero.png         (1920x1080 - hero background)
├── permission.png   (1920x1080 - section with id="permission")
├── compassion.png   (1920x1080 - section with id="compassion")
├── stories.png      (1920x1080 - section with id="stories")
└── together.png     (1920x1080 - section with id="together")

Referencing images in frontmatter:
hero:
  image: ./hero.png

sections:
  - id: "permission"
    layout: "image-text"
    image: ./permission.png

Layout types that use images:
- "image-text": Image appears beside text (1920x1080 recommended)
- "full-width-image": Image as background with text overlay (1920x1080 or larger)
- "text-only": No image needed
